# Introduce

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of devices that feeds data into a platform to enable communication and automated control. IoT connects machines to other machines as well as people. This seamless connection between machines, humans, and data means that IoT simplifies, improves, and automates processes. Sensors, coupled with connectivity and artificial intelligence, have the potential to make several systems more efficient. Therefore, an IoT mobile application is necessary to provide information to users timely. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Feature
